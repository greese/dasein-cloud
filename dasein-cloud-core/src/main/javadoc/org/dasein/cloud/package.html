  <p>
    Base package for the Dasein Cloud API. The entry point into leveraging this library is the
    {@link org.dasein.cloud.CloudProvider} class. The API does not currently support any fancy bootstrapping mechanism.
    Instead, you simply construct an implementation of the {@link org.dasein.cloud.CloudProvider} API appropriate to
    your target cloud.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cloud provider gives access to all supported services within the target cloud. Any service
    that is wholly unsupported will return <code>null</code>. An application will thus request
    its cloud provider using whatever bootstrapping mechanism is appropriate to its environment
    and then request the services it desires:
  </p>
  <pre>
    // Print out all regions supported in this cloud
    CloudProvider provider = new AmazonWebServices();
    ProviderContext context = new ProviderContext();
    DataCenterServices dc;
    
    // Not shown: Setting the AWS access credentials 
    // When done, call provider.init(context) with the set credentials
    provider.connect(context);
    dc = provider.getDataCenterServices();
    for( Region region : dc.listRegions() ) {
        System.out.println(region.getName());
    }
  </pre>
  <h2>Notes for Implementors</h2>
  <p>
    Begin implementing this API by writing an implementation of the {@link org.dasein.cloud.CloudProvider} abstract
    class. The simplest provider package for Dasein Cloud is an implementation of
    {@link org.dasein.cloud.CloudProvider} that returns <code>null</code> for all services. Of course, you probably
    want to tie into specific services and thus your implementation should return implementations
    of all relevant services.
  </p>
